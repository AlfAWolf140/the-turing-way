## Workshops

In March 2019, the project team ran three [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) related workshops.

### Boost your reproducibility with Binder

Aimed at researchers to understand how to use Binder to make their work reproducible.

* [Manchester - 1 March 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/boost-your-research-reproducibility-with-binder-manchester-registration-55331997494)
* [London - 12 March 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/boost-your-research-reproducibility-with-binder-london-registration-55337162944)

Those workshops were attended by 32 people.

### Build a BinderHub

Aimed at research software engineers and information technology professionals to learn how to build their own BinderHub.

* [Sheffield - 18 March 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/build-a-binderhub-registration-55336756729)

The workshop had 13 attendees.

## Book dashes

In May 2019, the project team will run two book dashes, one day events to edit the handbook and add additional content.
The book dashes are scheduled in
* [Manchester - 16 & 17 May 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-manchester-book-dash-tickets-60865553509)
* [London - 27 & 28 May 2019](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-turing-way-london-book-dash-tickets-60868662809)

Thirteen applicants were invited to each event (26 total) from an application pool of 37.

## Newsletter

Once per month, the Turing Way project team sends out a newsletter to its community.
The initial announcement was promoted on several relevant mailing lists including

- everyone@rse.ac.uk
- RESEARCH-DATAMAN@JISCMAIL.AC.UK

and various local networks of the project members.

The Turing Way newsletter archive is available at https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay.
There have been four newsletters to date, and as of today, the newsletter has 204 subscribers.

## Blogs

Becky Arnold, Turing Way project member and Software Sustainability Institute Fellow 2018, promoted the project on the Software Sustainability Institute blog on 18 March 2019: https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-03-05-turing-way-open-source-resource-promoting-best-practice-reproducible-research
