## Newsletter
Once per month, the Turing Way project team sends out a newsletter to its community.
The initial announcement was promoted on several relevant mailing lists including
- everyone@rse.ac.uk
- RESEARCH-DATAMAN@JISCMAIL.AC.UK

and various local networks of the project members.  

The Turing Way newsletter archive is available at https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay
As of today, the newsletter has 204 subscribers.

## Blogs

Becky Arnold, Turing Way project member and Software Sustainability Institute Fellow 2018, promoted the project on the Software Sustainability Institute blog on 18 March 2019: https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-03-05-turing-way-open-source-resource-promoting-best-practice-reproducible-research

## Workshops
In March 2019, the project team ran three [binder](https://mybinder.org/) related workshops. 

### Boost your reproducibility with Binder
Aimed at researchers to understand how to use binder to make their work reproducible.

* [Manchester - 1st March](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/boost-your-research-reproducibility-with-binder-manchester-registration-55331997494)
* [London - 12th March](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/boost-your-research-reproducibility-with-binder-london-registration-55337162944)

Those workshops were attended by 32 people.

### Build a BinderHub
Aimed at Research Software Engineers and researchers to learn how to build their own BinderHub.

* [Sheffield - 18th March](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/build-a-binderhub-registration-55336756729)

The workshop had 13 attendees.

## Book dashes
In May 2019, the project team will run two book dashes, one day events to edit the handbook and add additional content. 
The book dashes are scheduled in
* Manchester on 16 and 17 May 2019
* London on 27 and 28 May 2019

13 applicants were invited to each event.

## The Turing Way Handbook

The handbook is available at https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/

It contains chapters on
* Reproducbility
* Open Research
* Version Control
* Reproducible Environments
* Testing
* Reviewing
* Continous Integration
* Research Data Management
* Reproducbile Research with Make

Overall, the handbook and project GitHub repository have more than 20 contributors.
